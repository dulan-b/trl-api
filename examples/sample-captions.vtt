Welcome to The Ready Lab course.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
In this video, we'll cover the fundamentals of entrepreneurship.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.000
Let's start with understanding your target market.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Market research is the foundation of any successful business.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000
You need to identify who your customers are.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.000
And what problems they're trying to solve.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.000
Once you understand your market, you can create a product that fits their needs.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.000
This is what we call product-market fit.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.000
In the next lesson, we'll dive deeper into customer interviews.
